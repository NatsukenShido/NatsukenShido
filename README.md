### Hi,　僕わShidoNatsです！！, I like **Rhythm and Gacha games** in general (_and obviously I watch anime_)
and additionally I like all things related to the Japanese culture.

I'm an avid **Blue Archive** fan and currently playing **osu!**, **Rotaeno**, and **PJSK** as my rhythm games.
Here's a link to my spotify clone if ya'll are interested (psst it has Blue Archive OSTs innit):https://natsukenshido.github.io/shido-fy.github.io/main.html
